##MARVEL API

This browser based application connects to the Marvel API and allows the user to get a random comic based on the character entered.
You will be able to type in whatever Marvel character desired. You will then be presented with a random comic that they character appears in. If you like the selection you can click the 'YES!' button and you'll be taken to the Marvel site to find out how you can read the comic. Otherwise press 'Search' again and it'll search for another random comic containing the Marvel character.

So...give it a shot!
