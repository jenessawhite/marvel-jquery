##MARVEL API

This browser based application connects to the Marvel API and allows the user to get a random comic based on the character entered.
They will be able to type in whatever Marvel character desired. They will then be presented with a random comic that they character appears in. If they like the selection they can click the 'LET'S DO IT!' and they'll be taken to the Marvel site to find out how they can read the post. If they aren't interested (judging a book by the cover, tsk tsk) they'll have the option to select 'Eh! Not so much' which will search for another random comic containing the Marvel character.

So...give it a shot!

Enjoy!
